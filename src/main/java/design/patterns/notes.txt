Creational pattern: For creation of objects
    Factory method
    Abstract factory/Factory of factories
    Singleton
    Builder

Structural patterns: To enable combining objects into flexible structures
    Adapter: Make objects with incompatible interfaces work together by introducing an adapter between
    Bridge: Organizing classes into different hierarchies instead of having all dimensions of evolution
     in same hierarchy so that they can evolve independently. Then use HAS-A relationship to combine those hierarchies.
    Composite: When we have a structure consisting of a tree hierarchy of objects(via composition) and
    we need all objects in the structure to exhibit certain common behaviour, like rotating/translating all
    child objects in a scenegraph
